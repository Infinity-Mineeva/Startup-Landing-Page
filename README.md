Introduction
---
This is a fully responsive Startup Landing page where people can sign up to receive update emails about an soon-to-be-launched Startup company.

This project is from the "Complete Web Developer in 2022: Zero to Mastery" course on the [Zero-to-Mastery website](https://zerotomastery.io/).

Methodology
---
For this project, I simply followed along with the video tutorial to get a better feel for Bootstrap.


<br>

Tools I Used
---
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap
* Mailchimp


<br>

What I learned
---

After hearing about Bootstrap for a while, I finally see it in action. I can honestly say that I see the appeal. The ease in which you can have a lovely layout up and running quickly is awesome to me, and the fact that you can still customize elements with your own CSS is fabulous.

<br>

Items for further study
---
I will DEFINITELY explore Bootstrap more on my own; playing around with my own sites and familiarize myself with all the things this framework can do.
